        <p>
          A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of
          elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements
          should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule
          applied to them. The element or elements which are selected by the
          selector are referred to as the <em>subject of the selector</em>.
        </p>

          <img
            src="/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Basic_selectors/selector.png"
            alt="Some code with the h1 highlighted."
            width="471"
            height="218"
            loading="lazy" />
        </p>
        <p>
          In earlier articles you may have met some different selectors, and
          learned that there are selectors that target the document in different
          ways — for example by selecting an element such as <code>h1</code>, or
          a class such as <code>.special</code>. Let's start off by recapping
          the main ones you've already seen.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section aria-labelledby="type_selectors">
        <h2 id="type_selectors">
          <a href="#type_selectors">Type selectors</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          A <strong>type selector</strong> is sometimes referred to as a
          <em>tag name selector</em> or <em>element selector</em> because it
          selects an HTML tag/element in your document. In the example below, we
          have used the <code>span</code>, <code>em</code> and
          <code>strong</code> selectors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Try editing the following example (click <strong>"Play"</strong> to
          open it in the MDN Playground) to add a CSS rule that selects the
          <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element and changes its color to blue:
        </p>
      </section>
      <section aria-labelledby="class_selectors">
        <h2 id="class_selectors">
          <a href="#class_selectors">Class selectors</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          The case-sensitive class selector starts with a dot (<code>.</code>)
          character. It will select everything in the document with that class
          applied to it. In the live example below we have created a class
          called <code>highlight</code>, and have applied it to several places
          in my document. All of the elements that have the class applied are
          highlighted.
        </p>

          >
        </h3>
        <p>
          Try editing the above example (using MDN Playground) to make the
          following changes:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Edit the HTML to change the content the
            <code>.highlight</code> styles are applied to. You could for example
            add some <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements to wrap different parts
            of the existing content and apply the <code>highlight</code> class
            to those, remove some existing <code>highlight</code> classes, or
            add some new content to apply the <code>highlight</code> class to.
          </li>
          <li>
            Edit the CSS to modify the declarations inside the
            <code>.highlight</code> rule, adding new ones if you feel like it,
            and note how this affects the styling of all elements that have the
            <code>highlight</code> class applied.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create a new class rule inside the CSS with different declarations
            inside it (for example, with a selector of
            <code>.highlight2</code>), then try applying that to some of your
            HTML.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section aria-labelledby="targeting_classes_on_particular_elements">
        <h3 id="targeting_classes_on_particular_elements">
          <a href="#targeting_classes_on_particular_elements"
            >Targeting classes on particular elements</a
          >
        </h3>
        <p>
          You can create a selector that will target specific elements with the
          class applied. In this next example, we will highlight a
          <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> with a class of
          <code>highlight</code> differently to an
          <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> heading with a class of
          <code>highlight</code>. We do this by using the type selector for the
          element we want to target, with the class appended using a dot, with
          no white space in between.
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach reduces the scope of a rule. The rule will only apply to
          that particular element and class combination. You would need to add
          another selector if you decided the rule should apply to other
          elements too.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section
        aria-labelledby="target_an_element_if_it_has_more_than_one_class_applied">
        <h3 id="target_an_element_if_it_has_more_than_one_class_applied">
          <a href="#target_an_element_if_it_has_more_than_one_class_applied"
            >Target an element if it has more than one class applied</a
          >
        </h3>
        <p>
          You can apply multiple classes to an element and target them
          individually, or only select the element when all of the classes in
          the selector are present. This can be helpful when building up
          components that can be combined in different ways on your site.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the example below, we have a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> that contains
          a note. The grey border is applied when the box has a class of
          <code>notebox</code>. If it also has a class of
          <code>warning</code> or <code>danger</code>, we change the
          <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-color"
            ><code>border-color</code></a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can tell the browser that we only want to match the element if it
          has two classes applied by chaining them together with no white space
          between them. You'll see that the last
          <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> doesn't get any styling applied, as it only
          has the <code>danger</code> class; it needs <code>notebox</code> as
          well to get anything applied.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section aria-labelledby="id_selectors">
        <h2 id="id_selectors"><a href="#id_selectors">ID selectors</a></h2>
        <p>
          The case-sensitive ID selector begins with a <code>#</code> rather
          than a dot character, but is used in the same way as a class selector.
          The difference is that an ID can be used only once per page, and
          elements can only have a single <code>id</code> value applied to them.
          It can select an element that has the <code>id</code> set on it, and
          you can precede the ID with a type selector to only target the element
          if both the element and ID match. You can see both of these uses in
          the following example:
        </p>
        <div>
          <p>
            <strong>Warning:</strong> Using the same ID multiple times in a
            document may appear to work for styling purposes, but don't do this.
            It results in invalid code, and will cause strange behavior in many
            places.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section aria-labelledby="playing_with_id_selectors">
        <h3 id="playing_with_id_selectors">
          <a href="#playing_with_id_selectors">Playing with ID selectors</a>
        </h3>
        <p>Try editing the above example to make the following changes:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Edit the HTML to apply the <code>#one</code> styles to the first
            paragraph rather than the second.
          </li>
          <li>
            Edit the CSS to modify the declarations inside the ID selectors, and
            note how this changes the look of the HTML.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section aria-labelledby="selector_lists">
        <h2 id="selector_lists">
          <a href="#selector_lists">Selector lists</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          If you have more than one thing that uses the same CSS then the
          individual selectors can be combined into a <em>selector list</em> so
          that the rule is applied to all of the individual selectors. For
          example, if I have the same CSS for an <code>h1</code> and also a
          class of <code>.special</code>, I could write this as two separate
          rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could also combine these into a selector list, by adding a comma
          between them.
        </p>
        <p>
          White space is valid before or after the comma. You may also find the
          selectors more readable if each is on a new line.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section aria-labelledby="playing_with_selector_lists">
        <h3 id="playing_with_selector_lists">
          <a href="#playing_with_selector_lists">Playing with selector lists</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
          In the example below, try combining the two selectors which have
          identical declarations. The visual display should be the same after
          combining them.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section aria-labelledby="invalid_selectors_in_selector_lists">
        <h3 id="invalid_selectors_in_selector_lists">
          <a href="#invalid_selectors_in_selector_lists"
            >Invalid selectors in selector lists</a
          >
        </h3>
        <p>
          When you group selectors in this way, if any selector is syntactically
          invalid, the whole rule will be ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the following example, the invalid class selector rule will be
          ignored, whereas the <code>h1</code> would still be styled.
        </p>
        <p>
          When combined however, neither the <code>h1</code> nor the class will
          be styled as the entire rule is deemed invalid.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section aria-labelledby="the_universal_selector">
        <h2 id="the_universal_selector">
          <a href="#the_universal_selector">The universal selector</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          The universal selector is indicated by an asterisk (<code>*</code>).
          It selects everything in the document. If <code>*</code> is chained
          using a
          <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Descendant_combinator"
            >descendant combinator</a
          >, it selects everything inside that ancestor element. For example,
          <code>p *</code> selects all the nested elements inside the
          <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the following example, we use the universal selector to remove the
          margins on all elements. Instead of the browser's default styling,
          which spaces out headings and paragraphs with margins, everything is
          close together.
        </p>
        <p>
          This kind of behavior can sometimes be seen in "reset stylesheets",
          which strip out all of the browser styling. Since the universal
          selector makes global changes, we use it for very specific situations,
          such as the one described below.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section
        aria-labelledby="using_the_universal_selector_to_make_your_selectors_easier_to_read">

            >Using the universal selector to make your selectors easier to

          >
        </h3>
        <p>
          One use of the universal selector is to make selectors easier to read
          and more obvious in terms of what they are doing. For example, if we
          wanted to select any descendant elements of an
          <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element that are the first child of their
          parent, including direct children, and make them bold, we could use
          the
          <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:first-child"
            ><code>:first-child</code></a
          >
          pseudo-class. We will learn more about this in the lesson on
          <a
            href="/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Pseudo_classes_and_elements"
            >pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements</a
          >:
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this selector could be confused with
          <code>article:first-child</code>, which will select any
          <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element that is the first child of
          another element.
        </p>
        <p>
          To avoid this confusion, we can add the universal selector to the
          <code>:first-child</code> pseudo-class, so it is more obvious what the
          selector is doing. It is selecting <em>any</em> element which is the
          first-child of an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element, or the
          first-child of any descendant element of <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>:
        </p>
        <p>
          Although both do the same thing, the readability is significantly
          improved.
