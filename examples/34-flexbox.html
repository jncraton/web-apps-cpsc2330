      <h2>Computer Science</h2>
      <p>The mission of the Department of Computer Science is to provide students with a strong foundation in the field, build a love for lifelong learning, and ignite a desire to use their skills in service to the church and to society.</p>
      <p>The Department of Computer Science offers three standard majors — computer science (Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts), data science (Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts), and cybersecurity (Bachelor of Arts), which is an interdisciplinary major offered in conjunction with the security studies program. Also, for students wishing to add a concentration of coursework in these subjects to an existing major, two complementary majors are offered — computer science and data science. The knowledge and skills gained in these majors are uniquely suited to allow our students to be servant leaders in their communities.</p>
      <p>Anderson University computer science, cybersecurity, and data science students are immersed in project-based experiential learning in both the classroom and the community.</p>
      <p>Students develop and apply their knowledge outside the classroom by completing on-campus internships with area companies or the Center for Security Studies and Cyber Defense, working with Anderson University Information Technology Services, and working within the Department of Computer Science to install and maintain servers, network, and lab computers. Additional off-campus opportunities include internships with companies in the surrounding counties.</p>
      <p>Anderson University students in these majors are recognized by employers as having the key abilities necessary in quality employees: integrity, Christ-centered servant leadership, strong written and oral communication skills, problem-solving abilities, excellent computer science skills, and an eagerness to learn what is needed to solve problems.</p>
      <p>The curriculum for a bachelor’s degree in computer science at Anderson University follows the current Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) curriculum guidelines, incorporates software engineering throughout the curriculum, and provides students with the opportunity to use a wide array of software development technologies.</p>
      <p>During the freshman and sophomore years, students build the foundation of computer science knowledge while also developing the soft skills that employers value from a liberal arts education. Juniors and seniors focus on applying principles of this foundational knowledge and software engineering to advanced topics, including cybersecurity, computer networks, and operating systems. Teamwork, problem solving, and communication skills (written and oral) are emphasized throughout the program. Projects are oriented toward service to the surrounding community and the university when possible.</p>
      <p>A major in computer science allows graduates to pursue jobs in the technology sector, including software development, testing, information technology support, and web development, among many other opportunities. Students who intend to continue their education in graduate school or focus on computationally complex problems in the computer science industry should complete the requirements for the Bachelor of Science in computer science, which adds foundational courses in math and science as well as requiring an additional computer science course.</p>
      <p>A complementary major allows graduates to apply computer science in the specific area of their primary major; nearly any area of study can benefit from the use of computer science principles. The minor in computer science is designed for students who intend to use computer skills within a major to assist in the study of that major. Students are encouraged to speak with computer science faculty when selecting elective credit in order to choose courses that are most applicable to their concentration.</p>
      <p>Students majoring in computer science are urged to complete additional coursework in mathematics, accounting, business administration, physics, cybersecurity, or related areas.</p>
