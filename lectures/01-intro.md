## What is the Web?

- The World Wide Web is an information system
- It enables document and resource sharing
- The system is user-friendly and operates on the Internet

## Web vs. Internet

- The Internet is a global network of computers
- The Web is a collection of linked documents
- The Web uses the Internet as its infrastructure

## Birth of the Web

- Tim Berners-Lee conceived the Web at CERN
- The Web was invented in 1989
- He called it a "universal linked information system"

-----

What do you think was the biggest challenge in making the Web a reality for a global audience?

## Key Web Technologies

- The Web operates on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
- Resources are identified by a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
- The primary document type is HTML

## Hypertext

- HTML documents support text and media
- They also contain hyperlinks
- Hyperlinks allow navigation between pages

## Early Web Browsers

- Graphical browsers made the Web more popular
- Mosaic was a key early browser

## CERN's Decision

- CERN made the Web's protocol royalty-free
- This decision was made in 1993
- The move was crucial for the Web's growth

-----

How would the Web be different today if CERN had charged for its use?

## Web's Purpose

- The Web was designed to share scientific information
- It was intended to be a common space
- Its purpose has since evolved

## Web's Core Function

- Web browsers render web pages
- Web servers store and deliver content
- The two work together to serve users

## Exercise

Draw a simple diagram showing how a web browser and a web server might interact to display a web page.

## The First Website

- The first website was at CERN
- It explained the Web and its purpose
- The original URL was [http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html)

## Web Evolution

- The Web has become the dominant platform
- It is used for education and commerce
- It is a platform for entertainment and government

-----

Should web access be considered a basic human right in the modern world? Why or why not?

## HTTP

- HTTP is a stateless protocol
- Each request is independent
- Sessions are maintained using cookies

## URL Structure

- A URL includes the protocol (e.g., http)
- It includes the domain name
- It also includes the path to the resource

## Key Page Technologies

- HTTP for content
- CSS for styling
- JavaScript for interactivity

## Importance of Standards

- HTML and HTTP are open standards
- This ensures interoperability
- It allows different developers to build for the Web

## The Open Web

- The Web's openness has fostered innovation
- It has prevented a single company from controlling it

## Exercise

Write down three ideas for a small web application that would use only public, freely available data.
